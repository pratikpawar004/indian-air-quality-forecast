## 📘 Overview

**Air Quality Index Predictor** is a machine learning web app built with **Streamlit** that predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** based on pollutant concentrations like PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃ — following **Central Pollution Control Board: CPCB
 (India)** standards.  
It provides real-time predictions, health impact analysis, and a beautifully visualized AQI scale.
